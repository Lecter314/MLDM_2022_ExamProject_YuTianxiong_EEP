Intermediate status report, please see in .../NES Prediction1.4.ipynb:
(Consider NES Prediction1.4 as current intermediate status, for a simple improvement, ver.1.5 obtain a score of 0.128, rank 837/1426. But the overall idea stays the same as ver.1.4)

what has been done:
1. intro
2. background of the contest
3. data preprocessing
4. feature engineering
5. statistical analysis
6. model construction (elementary)
7. fit, predict and submit
8. discussion

what should be done:
1. adding more features from external dataset
improvements
2. using methods like PCA rather than drop() for high corrs
3. examine the model more precisely (based on recent lectures)
4. prepare for project defense

p.s. sorry for the imperfect for...everything, this topic is really frontier but interesting, and actually I have no background in biology. I'll try by best, best regards
