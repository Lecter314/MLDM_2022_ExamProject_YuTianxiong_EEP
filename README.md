# MLDM_2022_ExamProject_YuTianxiong_EEP


Exam project for Tianxiong Yu, including Intermediate status report and project defence(in progress). For detailed working progress, please check in my hw repo:
...path/MLDM_2022_YuTianxiong_EEP/Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction/ . 

Consider I am the only team member, there's not much difference between which repo I put my work into, in hw or in project...

Basically in this repo I'll upload the critical improvements of my work, and in another(...path/MLDM_2022_YuTianxiong_EEP/Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction/) is for everything related to the exam project.
